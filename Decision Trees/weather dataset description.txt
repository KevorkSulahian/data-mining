The weather dataset is a data frame containing one year of daily observations from a single weather
station (Canberra). The weatherAUS dataset is a data frame containing over 35,000 daily observations
from over 45 Australian weather stations


MinTemp -  The minimum temperature in degrees celcius.
MaxTemp -  The maximum temperature in degrees celcius.
Rainfall -  The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm.
Evaporation -  The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am.
Sunshine -  The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
WindGustDir -  The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight.
WindGustSpeed -  The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight.
Temp9am -  Temperature (degrees C) at 9am.
RelHumid9am -  Relative humidity (percent) at 9am.

Cloud9am -  Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measrured in "oktas", which are a
unit of eighths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure
indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is copmletely overcast.

WindSpeed9am -  Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am.
Pressure9am -  Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am.
Temp3pm -  Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm.
RelHumid3pm -  Relative humidity (percent) at 3pm.
Cloud3pm - Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values.
WindSpeed3pm -  Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm.
Pressure3pm -  Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm.
ChangeTemp -  Change in temperature.
ChangeTempDir -  Direction of change in temperature.
ChangeTempMag - Magnitude of change in temperature.
ChangeWindDirect -  Direction of wind change.
MaxWindPeriod -  Period of maximum wind.
RainToday Integer: -  1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0.
TempRange - Difference between minimum and maximum temperatures (degrees C) in the 24 hours to 9am.
PressureChange - Change in pressure.
RISK_MM The amount of rain. A kind of measure of the "risk".
RainTomorrow The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?
